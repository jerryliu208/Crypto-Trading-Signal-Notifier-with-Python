# Crypto Trading Signal Assistant with Telegram Bot

This Python project provides a Telegram bot that helps cryptocurrency traders to stay updated on the latest trading signals. The bot analyzes the market using KD and MACD technical indicators and sends real-time notifications to subscribers when a buy or sell signal appears. Additionally, traders can query the bot at any time to check if a particular trading pair has a signal.
